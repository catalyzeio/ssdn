# This script is loosely adapted from the runit boot scripts, especially
# stage 3 for cleanup. It relies on /bin/sh to reap zombie processes and
# traps SIGINT and SIGTERM so it can ask daemontools to shut down all
# monitored processes.
#
# See also my_init from Phusion's baseimage-docker, which does the same
# thing in a more convoluted way.
